# Piecewise Linear Time Warping

This repo contains research code for time warping multi-dimensional time series, with a focus on neural data. The core functions are stable, but still under development. Please open issues at the first sign of trouble you encounter.

## Installing

This package isn't registered yet, so you need to install manually. Either download or clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ahwillia/affinewarp/
```

Then navigate to the downloaded folder:

```
cd /path/to/affinewarp
```

And install the package:

```
pip install .
```

You will need to repeat these steps if we update the code.

## Getting started

See the jupyter notebook demos in the `examples/` folder. The code is fairly well-documented but the tutorials can still be improved, so open issues if you run into trouble.
