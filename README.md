# Piecewise Linear Time Warping

This repo contains research code for time warping multi-dimensional time series, with a focus on neural data. The core functions are stable, but still under development. Please open issues at the first sign of trouble you encounter.

This package isn't registered yet, so you need to install manually. Either download or clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/ahwillia/affinewarp/
```

Then navigate to the downloaded folder:

```
cd /path/to/affinewarp
```

And install the package:

```
pip install .
```

You will need to repeat these steps if we update the code.
