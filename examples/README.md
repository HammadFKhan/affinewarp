These jupyter notebooks demonstrate the basic functionality of this package and reproduce the essential figures in our manuscript ([Williams et al., 2019](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661165v1)).

1) [**`shift_warping.ipynb`**](/examples/shift_warping.ipynb) - demonstrates "shift-only time warping" on a minimal dataset.
2) [**`piecewise_warping.ipynb`**](/examples/piecewise_warping.ipynb) - demonstrates the full range of time warping models (shift-only, linear, piecewise linear) and cross-validation procedures.
3) [**`olfaction/`**](/examples/olfaction/) - demonstrates automatic alignment of evoked olfactory responses (data provided by C. Wilson and D. Rinberg).
4) [**`orbitofrontal_cortex`**](/examples/orbitofrontal_cortex/) - demonstrates a preliminary analysis of the [ofc-2](https://crcns.org/data-sets/ofc/ofc-2/about-ofc-2) provided on CRCNS.
